📊 EDA & Feature Engineering Notebook

Welcome! 👋
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering workflow designed to help understand data patterns, uncover insights, and build a strong foundation for predictive modeling.

The notebook (1-eda-feature-engineering.ipynb) walks through each step in a clean, beginner-friendly, and practical manner.

🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on:

Understanding the dataset structure

Cleaning and preprocessing raw data

Visualizing key trends and distributions

Handling missing values and outliers

Creating meaningful engineered features

Preparing the dataset for machine-learning tasks

This workflow is ideal for students, developers, or anyone building a data-driven project or ML pipeline.
